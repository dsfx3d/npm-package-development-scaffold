# npm-package-development-scaffold

> woosh...

A boilerplate project so you won't have to worry about the tedious task of setting up the local development environment for your next awesome npm package.

This got you covered from linting your code to automatic release on npm via CI.

## Installation

You can fork it :fork_and_knife: or clone it :sheep: and make it your own.

Or copy this repository in your system using [degit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/degit):

```bash
npx degit dsfx3d/npm-package-development-scaffold
```

## Setup

In a few steps, you can start building npm package:

> If you've copied the repository using degit, setup your github before you begin.

1. Login to [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/) using your GitHub account to allow permissions to track changes in your repository.

2. Create an account on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/degit). If you already have an account skip this step.

3. Install project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. setup semantic-release

   ```bash
   npm run setup:release
   ```

   **Important:** Always use commit script in `package.json` to commit your work. Otherwise, release won't be triggered when you push your changes.

   ```bash
   npm run commit
   ```

5. And you're ready to develop :muscle:
   From now on all you have to do is:

   1. Make changes to the repository.
   ii. Commit using `npm run commit`.
   iii. push changes to remote master branch.

:dart: Voila it's a release

## Includes

### Typescript

[Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is a language of choice of many developers when developing npm packages. If you are not using it in your npm packages yet, you should.

### Prettier + tslint

[Prettier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier), for code formatting. Formats not just javascript and typescript but a lot of other languages and not just programming languages but JSON, CSS, SCSS, HTML, Vue, Angular, GraphQL, Markdown, YAML etc. (**note:** A prettier plugin for your code editor is a recommended for better experience).

For everything else required for linting your code, there's always [tslint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/).

### Jest

[Jest](https://jestjs.io/en/) is a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity. Jest is a lot more than a test runner, it includes a powerful assertion library and code coverage reports. Go check docs.

### Babel

[Babel](https://babeljs.io/) is an OG when it comes to transpilers. If you are wondering why are we using babel if we already have typescript, you might wanna read this post. [TypeScript With Babel: A Beautiful Marriage](https://iamturns.com/typescript-babel/).

### GitHub Actions

[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) makes it easy to automate all your software workflows, now with world-class CI/CD. Build, test, and deploy your code right from GitHub. Make code reviews, branch management, and issue triaging work the way you want.

### Sementic Release CLI + Commitizen CLI

> Trust us, this will change your workflow for the better. â€“ egghead.io

[semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) automates the whole package release workflow including: determining the next version number, generating the release notes and publishing the package.

For semantic-release to determine the next version, you are expected to follow a certian format in your commit messages but with Commitizen CLI you don't have to worry about it. When you commit with [Commitizen](https://www.npmjs.com/package/commitizen), you'll be prompted to enter the required information and it will generate the formatted commit message for you. Now semantic-release can determine if your commit will be a release and how to bump the version number.

This removes the immediate connection between human emotions and version numbers, strictly following the [Sem'Ver](https://semver.org/) specification.

### Webpack (bonus)

If you wanna bundle your build for browsers.
